# Accredify_Application (PokeDex) üïπÔ∏è

## What is this Project about? üéØ
For my Accredify Internship Application, I was tasked to create a mini frontend project using Vue.JS and Jest for Unit Testing which included at 1 API Integrations, and 1-2 routes/ pages. This project showcases a Pokedex which Users can search for Pokemons by Name and view its characteristics in the PokeDex.

## My Learning Journey üìñ
I managed to develop this project across the span of 1 week, while juggling with my full-time studies and external commitments at NTU. Having prior knowledge in React.JS and TailwindCSS allowed me to quickly learn Vue.JS and create the structure for this frontend project. However, as I was new to the concept of API Integration as well as Unit Testing, I spent more time learning and implementing these features into this website. Nevertheless, I'm proud of having gained the following learning experiences:
1. Vue.JS framework for developing interactive user interfaces 
2. Extracting data from an API and utilising API endpoints (i.e. fetching and destructuring JSON data from PokeAPI).
3. Developing Unit Testing Scripts to test whether the expected UI components are rendered on the webpage as expected.
4. Website Routing and uses of Slug URLs, and its use in creating MultiPage Applications.

## Design Considerations üñåÔ∏è
During my requirement and analysis phase, I wanted to create a simple frontend website which fetches PokeAPI, extract data and render it on the browser DOM, and allow Users to  I used TailwindCSS which is simple CSS utility class to write styling scripts for my frontend application.

## Potential Improvements üíé
Given more time and resources, I would like to fully implement the additional features to make my PokeDex website more robust, functional and interactive for end-users, thereby enhancing their overall user experience. 

**User Experience**
1. Providing more content from API calls, and render images (e.g. Location Maps, Berries, Evolution Chains) 
2. Refine Search Engine (e.g. Search by Type, Regions, Pokemon Evolution Chain)
4. Mobile-first Implementation
 
**Content Management**
1. Allow Users to manually filter and customize their PokeDex Page (Checkbox options)  
2. Optimize API calls and Code Structure
3. Caching of data for frequently accessed data

Thank you for taking your time to read this documentation! I truly appreciate it :D
