# Accredify_Application (PokeDex) 

## Purpose of this project üéØ
For my Accredify Internship Application, I was tasked to create a mini frontend project using Vue.JS and Jest for Unit Testing which included at 1 API Integrations, and 1-2 routes/ pages. 

## What is this Project about? üïπÔ∏è
This project showcases a Pokedex which users can search for Pokemons by Name and view its characteristics in the PokeDex, to understand more about the Pokemon and its features.

## My Learning Journey üìñ
I managed to develop this project across the span of 1 week, while juggling with my full-time studies and external commitments at NTU. Having prior knowledge in React.JS and TailwindCSS allowed me to quickly learn Vue.JS and create the structure for this frontend project. However, as I was new to the concept of API Integration as well as Unit Testing, I spent more time learning and implementing these features into this website. Nevertheless, I'm proud of having gained the following learning experiences:
1. Vue.JS framework for developing interactive user interfaces 
2. Extracting data from an API and utilising API endpoints (i.e. fetching and destructuring JSON data from PokeAPI).
3. Developing Unit Testing Scripts to test whether the expected UI components are rendered on the webpage as expected.
4. Website Routing and uses of Slug URLs, and its use in creating MultiPage Applications.

## Design Considerations üñåÔ∏è
Given the recommended timeframe (4 - 5 hours), I used TailwindCSS which is simple CSS utility class to write styling scripts for my frontend application. During my requirement and analysis phase, I wanted to design a simple Pokedex which users
